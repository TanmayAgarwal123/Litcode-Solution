Egyptian Fraction
You are an ancient Egyptian mathematician, and you have been tasked with representing the fraction 6/14 as a sum of unique unit fractions. You know that a unit fraction is a fraction with a numerator of 1 and a denominator of a positive integer. You also know that the sum of any number of unit fractions is always a rational number.
Example:
The first step is to find the largest possible unit fraction that is less than or equal to 6/14. This fraction is 1/3. The remaining fraction is 6/14 - 1/3 = 4/42. The largest possible unit fraction that is less than or equal to 4/42 is 1/11. The remaining fraction is 4/42 - 1/11 = 1/231.
Therefore, the Egyptian fraction representation of 6/14 is 1/3 + 1/11 + 1/231.
